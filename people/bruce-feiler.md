## Agile programming for your family

Kids number 1 wish is not "spend more time with parents", it is "less stressed and tired parents"

Benefits:

- Increased communication
- Decreased stress

Meetings:

- Less than 20 minutes
- What worked well this week?
- What didn't work well this week?
- What shall we focus on next week? (What are we going to work on the week ahead?)

Before agile, 83% of software projects failed. Agile came in 2001 when an agile manifesto was made

Agile paradigms:

- Most successful, are most flexible
- Succeed, or fail, quickly
- You build it, bring it back, we'll talk about it, and adapt

Mornings:

- Accountability; each person has a checklist
- Each child ticks of chores
- You can't underestimate the power of a checkmark

Three planks:

- Adapt all the time; be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win
	- If you're doing the same thing today, as 6 months ago, then you were doing the wrong thing
- Empower your children
	- Reverse the waterfall as much as possible, enlist the children as much as possible
	- Children who plan their own goals, set their weekly work, build their frontal cortex, are more in control of their daily lives
- Tell your story
	- Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock
	- Preserve the core, stimulate progress
	- Define your mission, identify your core values
	- Create a family mission statement
	- What's important to us?
	- What values do we uphold?
	- Less time on what we do wrong, more focus on what we do right
	- Get the kids to know their family history
		- Did you know blah about blah
	- People who have a sense that they are part of larger story, have greater self confidence
	- Give children a happy narrative, you give themselves the tools to be happy

Each happy families are alike. Each unhappy family is different.

Happiness is not something we find. It is something we make.

Greatness is not a creation of circumstance, it's a creation of choice.

What's the secret to a happy family? Try.

Ideas:

- Time shift family dinners; have at least 10 minutes of family time each day
- If you're sitting on a hard chair, you'll be rigid, soft cushion, you'll be soft
	- Sit straight, on a hard cushioned chair, sit level

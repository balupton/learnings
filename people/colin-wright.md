## # TEDxPhnomPenh: Extreme Lifestyle Experiments

A controlled period of time over an extended period of time, made to offer a different perspective.

Cycles are dangerous, as they blind you from other options, other options that could help you get there faster.

You can find something interesting in anything.

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results. This is the stuck in the cycle problem. You gotta change something, before you can change the direction of your life. You gotta change yourself, before your change your actions.

I was aiming towards the wrong goal, I had to pivot, and focus on a more correct goal.

Got a problem, something needs to change, you need to change.

Lifestyle experiment process:

1. Identify: Identify the problem (that is *really* causing you the most drama and pain) before you start working on the solution.
2. Plan: Identify your exact perfect lifestyle, and work backward from that. How did you get there? What was the step before that? and before that? and before that? and eventually you'll work back to where you are now, so you know the steps to walk to get to your goal.
3. Rules: Establishing rules & guidelines for the project. Anyone can do lifestyle changes, lifestyle expirements are measurable, they can tell you with data what changes you should make.
4. Jump: Move forward with things right away, before you're ready. Saying something is not for forever, helps you move forward without fear.

Saving time:

- It could be a new skill you need to learn
- It could be someone you need to meet

Lifestyle experiments are measurable, they are much more scientific than lifestyle changes. It is something that you can say "this worked, this didn't work, and how can I change based on these results"

Paralysis by analysis. People get caught up in over-thinking things. You just gotta jump.

If you're not looking at things from multiple standpoints, and making changes. Then you're insane.

You shouldn't be afraid of experiments, they are by far, the only way things have ever gotten better.

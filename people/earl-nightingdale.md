Choose your thoughts, and you choose your life.

If you dont try, there is no change. Try, calibrate, succeed.

The only thing that is impossible for a human to do, is to be like somebody else.

The most natural thing to do is follow the followers, to not check references, to be thoughtless about why, what and how, to have no plan, no purpose. They fill their life with nothingless, and die of boredom. Living that way by a total lack of decision, on the unspoken assumption on a way you are meant to live.

The surest way to never make another mistake in your life, is to look around and do the opposite of what everyone else is doing.

Andrew Carnegie; Take possesion of your mind. The man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take the possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled.

Positive thinking removes all kinds of energy blockages in the body.

Our willpower is what drives our thoughts, and our thoughts are what delivers our results. If we think negative thoughts, those negative thoughts will literally manifest despair. If we think positive thoughts (of the achievement our goals), those thoughts will literally manifest the realisation/accomplishment of our goals.

Earl Nightingdales's checklist:
- A goal: without a goal, you don't know where you're going. Man needs his roots deep in the main stream of a great choosing, and then he will move on his way, regardless of obstacles.
- Attidude: It is our attitude, towards our world, and all the people in it, that will determine the world's attitude and all the people's attitude toward us. People will react to us according to our attitude, and our attitude is the greatest gift we can be given. Animals of the gift of camoflage, the ability to change into the surroundings. Only man as the godlike power to make his surroundings change to fit him. Because his environment will change as he changes. A man's environment is a merciless mirror of him as human being. And if a man thinks his environment could do with improvement, all he has to do, is improve himself, and his environment will improve with him.
- Think: Think deliberatly with a purpose.
- The law of cause and effect: That our rewards are in exact proportion to our contribution, our service. If a man is unhappy with his rewards, all he has to do, is find a way of increasing his contribution, his service to the world.
- Truth: Unless everything we are doing is built on truth, then we may as well be building on sand, and it won't stand.
- Research & Development: How much money are you pumping back into yourself and your future, to make yourself better by next year? To love a little more, and hate a little a less.
- We become what we think about. You become what you think about most of the time. This is why thinking is so important, why goals are so vital.
- Imagination is everything, we can become what we can imagine.

Dean briggs; do your work, not just your work and no more, but a little more for the lavishing sake, that little more that is worth all the rest, and if you suffer as you must, and doubt if you must, do your work, put your heart into it, and the sky will clear, and then out of your very doubt and suffering will be born the surpreme joy of life.

Every idea, every thing has its flaws, however flaws have never prevented success. Only the belief they can, does.

The Golden Rule: Act upon to others, as you wish others to act upon you. Think upon others, as you wish others to think upon you. As in, if you wish to be wealthy, make others wealthy. If you wish to be treated with respect, treat others with respect. If you wish for your life to be brighter, make others lives brighter.

You may not get the result (compensation) in the way, the time or the format you expected, but you will get the compensation one way or the other.

Your attitudes, values, beliefs, memories, decisions, language, meta programs, time space matter and energy create your internal map of reality, which creates your state, physiology and behaviour. If you change any of them, you can break the pattern. Eg feeling down? Smile. Seriously it works.

In short, the meanings you associate to things, create your state, which leads to your behaviours, which manifest your results.

Cause and effect. Are you focused on results, or reasons?

Long term change: decide, commit, act (take a stance and enforce boundaries), focus on what it is you want, create a supportive environment, have ferocious curiosity, commitment and dedication.

Have no comfort zone. Break free of comfort zone.

Business is all about adding as much unusual value.

Happiness (love) for everything and meaningful relationships (compassion) to everyone are the key to wealth. Monetary richness is a side effect of this.

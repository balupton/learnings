# Albert Einstein

Einstein had an attitude were he took a fresh look at any question came his way. With this he was the greatest man of science of all time - in terms of **finding where the question is**.

To solve the problem of general relativity, before he even knew what it was, he would ask him "if I were on a motorbike going the speed of light, what would I see?" - the trick here, is he asks the question, and finds the answer, or rather, the trick is always with coming up with an intuitive question to ask that could reveal the answer to you.

It is impossible to know the results of your actions.

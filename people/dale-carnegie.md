## Influence

People like people who admire them.

Criticism (even positive) pre-cursors resentment and justification, only encouragement pre-cursors postive change.


## How to stop worrying and start living

### Chapter 2

Your worries of the past or the future have no place today. They will only lead to inaction. The only thing that matters is complete enthusiasm with today's tasks.

We are just like an hourglass, (that's a fact, we must accept that, and work with it.) One grain of sand at a time. One task at a time. No matter how much load we have.

(Ignoring a task spoils it, like food.)

Everyday is a new life to a wise man. Today is a new life.

I know now I will never be afraid, regardless of what life gives me. (Fear is a choice)

Life we learn too late is in the living, the tissue of everyday, the hour.

(This is all about balancing time perspectives, seems very present hedonistic)

Look to the salutation of the dawn.

1. Do I tend to put off living in the present in order to worry about the future or yearn for some magical ros√© garden over the horizon?
2. Do is sometimes in-bitter the present by regretting things that happened in the past that are over and done with?
3. Do I get up in the morning determined to seize the day, to get the utmost out of these 24 hours?
4. Could I get more out of this life by living in day-tight compartments?
5. When shall I start to do this? Next week? Today?


### Chapter 4

Anti-worry technique on failures;
1. Analyse the situation fearlessly and honestly. What is the worst that could possible happen for the result of this failure?
2. Reconcile yourself to accept the above. Things can always, and will always get better.
3. Improve upon the worst that you've accepted mentally. Prevent it from happening again. Learn from the experience.

Be willing to have it so; because acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.

I hadn't been thinking, I had only been worrying.

# Tony Robbins


I'll give you great content but that answer lies elsewhere.

We are our emotions. life is emotion. it is all about emotion. always ask what emotion do I need to do the best at this? Your emotion when expressed entirely will be instilled in the audience too.


## [Rapid Planning Method.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCixDx8bhXE)

Figure out the result before you figure out what to do.

Results focused, purpose driven, culture.


1. What's my outcome? What is the ultimate result I'm after? Be as clear and specific as possible! / What is the result, the outcome, that I truly want to achieve? This next week, what is the most important outcomes to get this week in my life and business? Focus on outcomes not on activities. Most people mistake movement for achievement, they mistake action items with outcomes. / If you think before every thing you do, what is my outcome, it'll accomplish a lot in a shorter amount of time.


2. Why do [you] want to do it? What's the purpose for yourself? / Emotional juice to keep going when things don't work out. You need purpose. Do you have enough juice to keep going when things don't work out? If not, how do you get it. / Purpose is more powerful than the objective. / You gotta know why you're doing it right now, not why you did it before. You need emotion behind it, in the current moment. Not the emotion than ran out a year ago when you started.


3. How do you do it?


## [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpc-t-Uwv1I)

Three decisions of destiny:

1. What am I going to focus on?

	Focus = feeling<br/>
	Past/present/future<br/>
	Self or others?

2. What does it mean?

	Is it the end or the beginning? Are you being punished or rewarded?

3. What are you going to do?

	Are you going to give up or move forward?


People like surprises that they want. Surprises they don't want, they call problems.

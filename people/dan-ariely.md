Motivation = Payment + meaning + creation + challenge + ownership + identity + pride + etc. Without these things, everyone performs equally poor.

Open-Collaboration (Meaning) companies offer this motivation, your changes are lasting, you get recognition, you get learning, and you get meaning, a challenge, and all that, making you perform way better. They are the new way, where information is shared freely and abundantly do to its free and infinite nature.

Closed-Sourced Confidential (Sisyphus) companies, you get told what to do, and you have to forget and leave behind the innovations you’ve created. NDAs are the remants of the industrial age, where a company own the physical product you have built (with no intelluectual skill) due to its costly and finite nature.

There are basically two ways to help people have enough money for retirement: getting them to save more and getting them to die younger. The easier one by far is getting people to die younger. How might you achieve this? By allowing the citizens to smoke, subsidizing sugary and fatty foods, and making it hard for them to get access to preventative health care. But, when you think about this, it seems like we’re already doing most of what we can on this front.

Let me tell you a secret. No one gets out of life alive. You can either die here, or die on the playing field, either way it’s the same, you still die, stop being afraid.

I went in there with complete determination, that those people’s lives only existed for signing this contract, that they fought off so many other sperm, just to sign this contract, that is the strength of the belief I had.

Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.

It’s possible.

Have you ever talked yourself out of something you’ve wanted?

I know how he could do it... There was no one around to tell him he couldn’t do it.

What could we do if we didn’t have the naysayers in our lives? What could we do if failure wasn’t an option?

Sometimes you gotta believe in somebody’s belief in you, until your belief in you starts.

Perfection doesn’t exist, throw it out. There is only improvement. Practice makes improvement.

You will fail your success. It doesn’t matter how many times you fail, or how hard you fail, you will fail a lot more, and each time learn and get better. The harder the goal, the more you’ll fail.

You gotta believe in yourself when no one else does.

Faith is the oil that takes the friction out of living.

You’ve got greatness in you. It’s possible to reach your dream.

Sometimes you just gotta fight yourself, convince yourself, tell yourself to shut up, and do it.

If there is an enemy within, then the enemy outside can harm you.

When you argue for your limitations you get to keep them.

Greatness is choices we make everyday.

In order to do something you’ve never done, you’ve gotta become someone you’ve never been.

I serve. I’m grateful and I laugh a lot. I meditate for 20 minutes first thing in the morning. And i read 10-15 pages of something positive. Affirmation - “Lord whatever I enounter today, I’ll be able to get through it.”. My whole goal when I wake up in the morning - what impact can I make?

If you’re the smartest one in your group, you need to get yourself a new group!

You gotta be relentless and unstoppable until you can get others to buy into the vision.

Purpose. Persistance. Pasion. People. Perserverance.

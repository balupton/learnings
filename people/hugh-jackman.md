# Hugh Jackman

Unless you are willing to accept the possibility of complete failure, you will never be able to have the courage required in order to achieve complete success.

You have to be able to make a fool of yourself (to fail abysmally) in order to be able to allow yourself to give it everything.

One of the greatest problems in relationships is that it is soo easy to take things for granted. It is soo easy to fall asleep in relationships, you can be asleep for years.

Acting is an opportunity to wake up.

Ben: There is a very fine line between ultimate success and failure. You have to give it everything you've got. And with practice, you begin to succeed more than fail. The more you give it, the quicker and more powerful the process and end result. You gotta be willing to fail, to accept death.

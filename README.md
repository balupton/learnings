# Learnings


The pioneer spirit has been in us since the start of time. Since we started, we've always had to conquer and explore for surival. It's ingrained.


## Hugh Jackman

Unless you are willing to accept the possibility of complete failure, you will never be able to have the courage required in order to achieve complete success.

You have to be able to make a fool of yourself (to fail abysmally) in order to be able to allow yourself to give it everything.

One of the greatest problems in relationships is that it is soo easy to take things for granted. It is soo easy to fall asleep in relationships, you can be asleep for years.

Acting is an opportunity to wake up.

Ben: There is a very fine line between ultimate success and failure. You have to give it everything you've got. And with practice, you begin to succeed more than fail. The more you give it, the quicker and more powerful the process and end result. You gotta be willing to fail, to accept death.



## Ben

Instead of thinking “this will fail unless I do these things”, instead think “This will kick ass because I will do these things” - this is essential for maintaining momemtum, as if you are thinking about why it will rock that propels, but if you’re thinking about what you need to do so it doesn’t fail, that is extra weight on your sholders holding you back.


## Einstein

Einstein had an attitude were he took a fresh look at any question came his way. With this he was the greatest man of science of all time - in terms of **finding where the question is**.

To solve the problem of general relativity, before he even knew what it was, he would ask him "if I were on a motorbike going the speed of light, what would I see?" - the trick here, is he asks the question, and finds the answer, or rather, the trick is always with coming up with an intuitive question to ask that could reveal the answer to you.

It is impossible to know the results of your actions.


## Dan Ariely

Motivation = Payment + meaning + creation + challenge + ownership + identity + pride + etc. Without these things, everyone performs equally poor.

Open-Collaboration (Meaning) companies offer this motivation, your changes are lasting, you get recognition, you get learning, and you get meaning, a challenge, and all that, making you perform way better. They are the new way, where information is shared freely and abundantly do to its free and infinite nature.

Closed-Sourced Confidential (Sisyphus) companies, you get told what to do, and you have to forget and leave behind the innovations you’ve created. NDAs are the remants of the industrial age, where a company own the physical product you have built (with no intelluectual skill) due to its costly and finite nature.

There are basically two ways to help people have enough money for retirement: getting them to save more and getting them to die younger. The easier one by far is getting people to die younger. How might you achieve this? By allowing the citizens to smoke, subsidizing sugary and fatty foods, and making it hard for them to get access to preventative health care. But, when you think about this, it seems like we’re already doing most of what we can on this front.


## Earl Nightingdale

Choose your thoughts, and you choose your life.

If you dont try, there is no change. Try, calibrate, succeed.

The only thing that is impossible for a human to do, is to be like somebody else.

The most natural thing to do is follow the followers, to not check references, to be thoughtless about why, what and how, to have no plan, no purpose. They fill their life with nothingless, and die of boredom. Living that way by a total lack of decision, on the unspoken assumption on a way you are meant to live.

The surest way to never make another mistake in your life, is to look around and do the opposite of what everyone else is doing.

Andrew Carnegie; Take possesion of your mind. The man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take the possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled.

Positive thinking removes all kinds of energy blockages in the body.

Our willpower is what drives our thoughts, and our thoughts are what delivers our results. If we think negative thoughts, those negative thoughts will literally manifest despair. If we think positive thoughts (of the achievement our goals), those thoughts will literally manifest the realisation/accomplishment of our goals.

Earl Nightingdales's checklist:
- A goal: without a goal, you don't know where you're going. Man needs his roots deep in the main stream of a great choosing, and then he will move on his way, regardless of obstacles.
- Attidude: It is our attitude, towards our world, and all the people in it, that will determine the world's attitude and all the people's attitude toward us. People will react to us according to our attitude, and our attitude is the greatest gift we can be given. Animals of the gift of camoflage, the ability to change into the surroundings. Only man as the godlike power to make his surroundings change to fit him. Because his environment will change as he changes. A man's environment is a merciless mirror of him as human being. And if a man thinks his environment could do with improvement, all he has to do, is improve himself, and his environment will improve with him.
- Think: Think deliberatly with a purpose.
- The law of cause and effect: That our rewards are in exact proportion to our contribution, our service. If a man is unhappy with his rewards, all he has to do, is find a way of increasing his contribution, his service to the world.
- Truth: Unless everything we are doing is built on truth, then we may as well be building on sand, and it won't stand.
- Research & Development: How much money are you pumping back into yourself and your future, to make yourself better by next year? To love a little more, and hate a little a less.
- We become what we think about. You become what you think about most of the time. This is why thinking is so important, why goals are so vital. 
- Imagination is everything, we can become what we can imagine.

Dean briggs; do your work, not just your work and no more, but a little more for the lavishing sake, that little more that is worth all the rest, and if you suffer as you must, and doubt if you must, do your work, put your heart into it, and the sky will clear, and then out of your very doubt and suffering will be born the surpreme joy of life.

Every idea, every thing has its flaws, however flaws have never prevented success. Only the belief they can, does.

The Golden Rule: Act upon to others, as you wish others to act upon you. Think upon others, as you wish others to think upon you. As in, if you wish to be wealthy, make others wealthy. If you wish to be treated with respect, treat others with respect. If you wish for your life to be brighter, make others lives brighter. 

You may not get the result (compensation) in the way, the time or the format you expected, but you will get the compensation one way or the other.

Your attitudes, values, beliefs, memories, decisions, language, meta programs, time space matter and energy create your internal map of reality, which creates your state, physiology and behaviour. If you change any of them, you can break the pattern. Eg feeling down? Smile. Seriously it works.

In short, the meanings you associate to things, create your state, which leads to your behaviours, which manifest your results.

Cause and effect. Are you focused on results, or reasons?

Long term change: decide, commit, act (take a stance and enforce boundaries), focus on what it is you want, create a supportive environment, have ferocious curiosity, commitment and dedication.

Have no comfort zone. Break free of comfort zone.

Business is all about adding as much unusual value.

Happiness (love) for everything and meaningful relationships (compassion) to everyone are the key to wealth. Monetary richness is a side effect of this.



## Echkart Tolle

Lack of progress pre supposes progress is being made. Whether it is positive or negative is choice of focus. Are you attaching your self to something?


## Dare to Win

Your continued focus prescribed what you will get in return. Try praying each day for a year for something. Have a conversation with the universe on how you two can team up to help each other out and accomplish it.


## Aur Muir

Failures are where we learn. So make them cheap, and do them often.

I look every day to fail, and hope that it isn't the same failure I'm making. That is progress.


## Chris Howard

Belief + expectation = hypnosis. Expectation rules outcomes.

Find a niche an inch across and a mile deep.

You might want to write this down. I need a loud yes or a big nod. Now I want you to now turn to the person next to you, tell them about what you're getting from this conversation about blah and how it might apply to your business.


## Tony Robbins

I'll give you great content but that answer lies elsewhere.

We are our emotions. life is emotion. it is all about emotion. always ask what emotion do I need to do the best at this? Your emotion when expressed entirely will be instilled in the audience too.


## Dale Carnegie
 
### Influence

People like people who admire them.

Criticism (even positive) pre-cursors resentment and justification, only encouragement pre-cursors postive change.

### Worry

#### Chapter 2

Your worries of the past or the future have no place today. They will only lead to inaction. The only thing that matters is complete enthusiasm with today's tasks.

We are just like an hourglass, (that's a fact, we must accept that, and work with it.) One grain of sand at a time. One task at a time. No matter how much load we have.

(Ignoring a task spoils it, like food.)

Everyday is a new life to a wise man. Today is a new life.

I know now I will never be afraid, regardless of what life gives me. (Fear is a choice)

Life we learn too late is in the living, the tissue of everyday, the hour.

(This is all about balancing time perspectives, seems very present hedonistic)

Look to the salutation of the dawn.

1. Do I tend to put off living in the present in order to worry about the future or yearn for some magical rosé garden over the horizon?
2. Do is sometimes in-bitter the present by regretting things that happened in the past that are over and done with?
3. Do I get up in the morning determined to seize the day, to get the utmost out of these 24 hours?
4. Could I get more out of this life by living in day-tight compartments?
5. When shall I start to do this? Next week? Today?


#### Chapter 4

Anti-worry technique on failures;
1. Analyse the situation fearlessly and honestly. What is the worst that could possible happen for the result of this failure?
2. Reconcile yourself to accept the above. Things can always, and will always get better.
3. Improve upon the worst that you've accepted mentally. Prevent it from happening again. Learn from the experience.

Be willing to have it so; because acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.

I hadn't been thinking, I had only been worrying.


## Les Brown

Let me tell you a secret. No one gets out of life alive. You can either die here, or die on the playing field, either way it’s the same, you still die, stop being afraid.

I went in there with complete determination, that those people’s lives only existed for signing this contract, that they fought off so many other sperm, just to sign this contract, that is the strength of the belief I had.

Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.

It’s possible.

Have you ever talked yourself out of something you’ve wanted?

I know how he could do it... There was no one around to tell him he couldn’t do it.

What could we do if we didn’t have the naysayers in our lives? What could we do if failure wasn’t an option?

Sometimes you gotta believe in somebody’s belief in you, until your belief in you starts.

Perfection doesn’t exist, throw it out. There is only improvement. Practice makes improvement.

You will fail your success. It doesn’t matter how many times you fail, or how hard you fail, you will fail a lot more, and each time learn and get better. The harder the goal, the more you’ll fail.

You gotta believe in yourself when no one else does.

Faith is the oil that takes the friction out of living.

You’ve got greatness in you. It’s possible to reach your dream.

Sometimes you just gotta fight yourself, convince yourself, tell yourself to shut up, and do it.

If there is an enemy within, then the enemy outside can harm you.

When you argue for your limitations you get to keep them.

Greatness is choices we make everyday.

In order to do something you’ve never done, you’ve gotta become someone you’ve never been.

I serve. I’m grateful and I laugh a lot. I meditate for 20 minutes first thing in the morning. And i read 10-15 pages of something positive. Affirmation - “Lord whatever I enounter today, I’ll be able to get through it.”. My whole goal when I wake up in the morning - what impact can I make?

If you’re the smartest one in your group, you need to get yourself a new group!

You gotta be relentless and unstoppable until you can get others to buy into the vision.

Purpose. Persistance. Pasion. People. Perserverance.


## TEDxPhnomPenh - Colin Wright - Extreme Lifestyle Experiments

A controlled period of time over an extended period of time, made to offer a different perspective.

Cycles are dangerous, as they blind you from other options, other options that could help you get there faster.

You can find something interesting in anything.

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results. This is the stuck in the cycle problem. You gotta change something, before you can change the direction of your life. You gotta change yourself, before your change your actions.

I was aiming towards the wrong goal, I had to pivot, and focus on a more correct goal.

Got a problem, something needs to change, you need to change.

Lifestyle experiment process:

1. Identify: Identify the problem (that is *really* causing you the most drama and pain) before you start working on the solution.
2. Plan: Identify your exact perfect lifestyle, and work backward from that. How did you get there? What was the step before that? and before that? and before that? and eventually you'll work back to where you are now, so you know the steps to walk to get to your goal.
3. Rules: Establishing rules & guidelines for the project. Anyone can do lifestyle changes, lifestyle expirements are measurable, they can tell you with data what changes you should make.
4. Jump: Move forward with things right away, before you're ready. Saying something is not for forever, helps you move forward without fear.

Saving time:

- It could be a new skill you need to learn
- It could be someone you need to meet

Lifestyle experiments are measurable, they are much more scientific than lifestyle changes. It is something that you can say "this worked, this didn't work, and how can I change based on these results"

Paralysis by analysis. People get caught up in over-thinking things. You just gotta jump.

If you're not looking at things from multiple standpoints, and making changes. Then you're insane.

You shouldn't be afraid of experiments, they are by far, the only way things have ever gotten better.


## Timothy Ferris

1. Define your fears, not your goals.
1. What could go wrong?
1. How to minimise the chance of that happening?
1. How to regain your status if something does go wrong?



## Asking for Advice
What is it that I'm wanting to get out of this conversation? What are the questions that will get me those results?

Be Specific. Ask quality questions. Be concise.

Noah Kagan: Be specific, we are busy people. I don't have time for the background.

Duane Alley: Right…. So what specifically are you asking? Don't waste my time with your life story.

Johnnie Cass: The results you get in life, is directly correlated to the quality of questions you ask. Dribble is not a question.

Jason Fried Be concise:  Every word counts, don't waste them.

## Bruce Feiler - Agile programming for your family 

Kids number 1 wish is not "spend more time with parents", it is "less stressed and tired parents"

Benefits:

- Increased communication
- Decreased stress

Meetings:

- Less than 20 minutes
- What worked well this week?
- What didn't work well this week?
- What shall we focus on next week? (What are we going to work on the week ahead?)

Before agile, 83% of software projects failed. Agile came in 2001 when an agile manifesto was made

Agile paradigms:

- Most successful, are most flexible
- Succeed, or fail, quickly
- You build it, bring it back, we'll talk about it, and adapt

Mornings:

- Accountability; each person has a checklist
- Each child ticks of chores
- You can't underestimate the power of a checkmark

Three planks:

- Adapt all the time; be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win
	- If you're doing the same thing today, as 6 months ago, then you were doing the wrong thing
- Empower your children
	- Reverse the waterfall as much as possible, enlist the children as much as possible
	- Children who plan their own goals, set their weekly work, build their frontal cortex, are more in control of their daily lives
- Tell your story
	- Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock
	- Preserve the core, stimulate progress
	- Define your mission, identify your core values
	- Create a family mission statement
	- What's important to us?
	- What values do we uphold?
	- Less time on what we do wrong, more focus on what we do right
	- Get the kids to know their family history
		- Did you know blah about blah
	- People who have a sense that they are part of larger story, have greater self confidence
	- Give children a happy narrative, you give themselves the tools to be happy

Each happy families are alike. Each unhappy family is different.

Happiness is not something we find. It is something we make.

Greatness is not a creation of circumstance, it's a creation of choice.

What's the secret to a happy family? Try.

Ideas:

- Time shift family dinners; have at least 10 minutes of family time each day
- If you're sitting on a hard chair, you'll be rigid, soft cushion, you'll be soft
	- Sit straight, on a hard cushioned chair, sit level



## [The First 20 Hours - How to Learn Anything: Josh Kaufman at TEDxCSU](http://youtu.be/5MgBikgcWnY)


How to learn anything fast

1. Deconstruct the skill; and break it down into smaller and smaller pieces; the more you break apart the skill, the more you can decide which sub-skills will help you the most
2. Learn enough to self-correct; get 3-5 resources about what you're trying to learn (but don't use them to procrastinate - practice comes first!) use them to learn just enough, so you can self-correct, and self-learn, through practice
3. Remove practice barriers; remove all distractions that get in the way of you doing work, practice always comes first
4. Practice at least 20 hours; sticking with it for 20 hours will get you over any initial hurdles, keeping you going on long term

**The major barrier to skill acquisition isn't intellectual... it's emotional**
